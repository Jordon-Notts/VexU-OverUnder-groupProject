# Trials

These are a list of things to test during the December in person week.

### Switching between games mode

Does the VEXnet Field Controller, switch automatically between auto mode and driver control mode. [[#Functions#Driver control mode]]

### Test the Go_to_position function

Test to see if the Go to position function actually causes the robot to go to the desired location. [](#Go to position)

It is important to find out if the combined error after moving to several consecutive locations is too big to be useable for the 45 seconds of autonomous game play.
